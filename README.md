BayesWave pipeline integration for [Asimov](https://git.ligo.org/asimov/asimov).

This package provides a plugin for Asimov 0.7+ that enables integration with the BayesWave parameter estimation pipeline for gravitational wave data analysis.

## Features

- 🔌 **Plugin Architecture**: Seamlessly integrates with Asimov via entry points
- 📊 **PSD Generation**: Automatic power spectral density estimation and collection
- 🔄 **Format Conversion**: Converts PSDs to XML format for use with other pipelines
  (where `convert_psd_ascii2xml` is available — see "Operational notes" below)
- 🚀 **Scheduler-agnostic**: Automated DAG generation and job submission via Asimov's
  HTCondor/Slurm scheduler API
- 📈 **Result Collection**: Automatic collection of megaplot outputs and visualizations
- 🎯 **PSD Suppression**: Support for suppressing frequency bands in PSDs
- 🧪 **Well Tested**: Unit tests plus a genuine end-to-end test (real `bayeswave_pipe` DAG
  generation and HTCondor execution — `BayesWave`, `BayesWavePost`, `megaplot.py` — against
  real GW150914 H1 GWOSC strain, waiting for a real, parseable
  `glitch_median_PSD_forLI_H1.dat`, not a smoke test)

## Installation

### Via Asimov (Recommended)

If you have asimov 0.7+, you can install gravitational wave pipelines including bayeswave with:

```bash
pip install asimov[gw]
```

This will automatically install asimov-bayeswave and other GW analysis plugins.

### From PyPI (when released)

```bash
pip install asimov-bayeswave
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/transientlunatic/asimov-bayeswave.git
cd asimov-bayeswave
pip install -e .
```

### For Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[docs,test]"
```

## Quick Start

Once installed, the BayesWave pipeline is automatically available in Asimov. 
To add a new bayeswave analysis you can create a blueprint YAML file like the following:

```yaml
kind: analysis
pipeline: bayeswave
comment: PSD generation with BayesWave
likelihood:
  sample rate: 2048
  segment length: 8
data:
  channels:
    H1: H1:GDS-CALIB_STRAIN
    L1: L1:GDS-CALIB_STRAIN
quality:
  minimum frequency:
    H1: 20
    L1: 20
```

## Usage

### Via Asimov CLI

```bash
# Build the DAG
asimov manage build --production Prod0

# Submit the job
asimov manage submit --production Prod0

# Monitor progress
asimov manage monitor
```

### Via Python API

```python
from asimov_bayeswave import BayesWave

# Create pipeline instance
pipeline = BayesWave(production)

# Build and submit
pipeline.build_dag()
pipeline.submit_dag()

# Collect results after completion
assets = pipeline.collect_assets()
psds = assets["psds"]
xml_psds = assets["xml psds"]
```

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.9
- asimov >= 0.7.0
- numpy
- BayesWave (must be installed separately) — via conda-forge:
  ```bash
  conda install -c conda-forge bayeswave bayeswaveutils
  ```
  `bayeswave` ships the compiled samplers (`BayesWave`, `BayesWavePost`, ...);
  `bayeswave_pipe` (the DAG-generation script this plugin's `build_dag()` shells out to)
  and `megaplot.py`/`megasky.py` come from the separate `bayeswaveutils` package. Unlike
  the sibling `asimov-lalinference` plugin, no `numpy<2` pin is needed — the current
  conda-forge `bayeswaveutils` build's `megaplot.py` has already been patched for numpy
  2.0.

## Operational notes

### `convert_psd_ascii2xml` is not available from public conda-forge packages

`after_completion()` tries to convert each ascii-format PSD to XML via a
`convert_psd_ascii2xml` executable. As of this writing that tool is not shipped by any
current public conda-forge package — `bayeswave`, `bayeswaveutils`, `lalinference` and
`lalapps` were all checked while building this plugin's end-to-end test, and none of them
provide it (it may only exist in older or IGWN-internal environments). `bayeswave` does
ship a `BayesWaveToLALPSD` executable that looks like a plausible modern replacement, but
its calling convention (positional run name, requires `--gnuplot` output enabled during
the original run, reads specific paths under `waveforms/`) is substantially different and
has not been validated here.

This is handled gracefully rather than worked around: `after_completion()` catches the
resulting `PipelineException`, logs it, and continues on to store the ascii-format PSD via
`store_assets()` regardless (see `collect_assets()["psds"]`). If your environment does
have a working `convert_psd_ascii2xml`, XML-format PSD conversion and storage will work as
documented above with no changes needed. If not, downstream pipelines that specifically
need an XML-format PSD (rather than the ascii format) won't get one from this plugin until
someone wires up `BayesWaveToLALPSD` (or an equivalent) as a real replacement.

## Documentation

Full documentation is available at [asimov-bayeswave.readthedocs.io](https://asimov-bayeswave.readthedocs.io).

### Building Documentation Locally

```bash
cd docs
make html
```

The built documentation will be in `docs/build/html/`.

## Testing

Run the unit test suite with:

```bash
pytest
```

For coverage reporting:

```bash
pytest --cov=asimov_bayeswave --cov-report=html
```

### End-to-end test

`.github/workflows/e2e.yml` runs a genuine end-to-end test on real GitHub Actions
infrastructure: a real `bayeswave_pipe` DAG (`BayesWave` clean run -> `BayesWavePost` ->
`megaplot.py`), submitted to and run by a real (disposable, in-container) HTCondor pool,
against real (trimmed, ~32s) GW150914 H1 GWOSC strain vendored into
`tests/test_data/frames/`. It waits for and validates a genuine, parseable
`glitch_median_PSD_forLI_H1.dat` — the same file `detect_completion()`/`collect_assets()`
themselves look for — not just "the DAG was submitted", and separately checks that a
production reaches a genuinely finished/uploaded state and that the missing
`convert_psd_ascii2xml` tool (see "Operational notes" above) is handled gracefully. It's
what found several of the real bugs described in `CHANGELOG.md`.
